# Copperfox Gov Sync PAPI  

## Overview  

The `copperfox-gov-sync-papi` is an API hosted on MuleSoft Gov Cloud. It processes Salesforce ContentDocuments for a given record ID by consolidating CSV files into a single file. If the consolidated file size is less than 10MB, it replaces all existing files on the parent record with the new file in Salesforce. If the file size is 10MB or more, a notification email is sent.  

## Project Structure
